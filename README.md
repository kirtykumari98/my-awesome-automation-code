🌟 Test Automation Framework – End-to-End QA Solution

This project is a comprehensive automation framework built to showcase professional test engineering skills across UI, API, and Database automation.
It demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and maintain scalable automation solutions following industry best practices.

🚀 Why Recruiters Should Care

This project highlights:
✅ Full-stack QA automation expertise – covering UI (Selenium), API (Rest Assured), and DB (JDBC).
✅ Framework design & architecture skills – built with design patterns, SOLID principles, and clean coding standards.
✅ Hands-on experience with industry tools – TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber (BDD), Log4j, Allure/Extent Reports.
✅ Modern Java practices – leveraging Java 8 (Streams, Lambdas, Functional Interfaces).
✅ Scalable & maintainable solutions – modular design, reporting, and logging for real-world project readiness.

This repository serves as a portfolio project that recruiters and hiring managers can review to validate my technical capabilities as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET).

🎯 Key Takeaways for Employers

I can independently build automation frameworks from scratch.
I apply software engineering principles (not just test scripts).
I cover multiple testing layers: UI, API, Database.
I ensure quality reporting, logging, and maintainability for real-world adoption.
This project demonstrates that I am prepared to contribute as an SDET / Automation Engineer in enterprise environments.

📌 Future Enhancements
Parallel execution & distributed testing with Selenium Grid/Docker
CI/CD pipeline integration (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
Cross-browser & mobile support (Appium)
Test data management improvements
Allure/Extend reort creation
